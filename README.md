# C4i Code Challenge
### We need to be able to:

- See the current date in the application.
- Create a new task.
- Name and rename tasks.
- Assign a date a task is due.
- Mark a task as completed.
- Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
- Highlight tasks that are completed in green.
- Highlight tasks that are overdue in red.

Please provide comments to explain your solution.

## Thoughts / Comments
- Continue on buttons/delete task
- I had followed a youtube video on how to do this. It was somewhat confusing and misleading at times but I have a window that can add and remove tasks.
- Not MVVM unfortunately, I believe it's mostly MVC. 
- More comments within code blocks

## Issues
- Learning a whole new language is challenging but exciting. I've never used WPF so that itself is a handuful.
- Delete button does not delete checked box, but deletes most recent task.
- Haven't implemented update or calender
